# Q&A

**Q:** The device showed me a link. What do I do here?  
**A:** Go to the [Projects](https://github.com/onepointfive-REAL/ArduinoNowPlayingVLC/releases) page and download the latest version. Then run `installlib.bat`, followed by `main.py` (requires Python)

**Q:** The program starts then immediately exits. What do I do?
**A:** Check if you set the COM port correctly and nothing is using the COM port.

**Q:** The program just says `VLC Offline` and does nothing else
**A:** Check if you configured the password properly on both VLC and the Python script.
